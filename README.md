# Instantly-Recognising-Objects

Task:
Watch this Ted Talk on how computers learn to recognise objects instantly. After watching
this video, discuss the benefits, limitations, and risks of the subject in the context of:

• Travel and Tourism:
The use of computers to instantly recognise objects could be invaluable to the improvement in both the speed and saftey with whitch we travel around the world. A computer outfitted with this software could be used to instantly observe passengers travelling through airport security and scan the visible items on their person, then alert the security staff to the presence of malicious items. While this could not be used exclusivly due to people attempting to conceal their belongings, it could help add another layer of safety to peoples journey whilst also making people feel safer due to the relaxed presence of pysical staff. However, technologie can be wrong, and could falsely flag someone as a dangerous person, disrupting their travel and causing panic for those around them.

• Gaming and Entertainment:
Gaming and many other hobbys involve many small pysical pieces, which are often left carelessly around someones house and are forgotten, till they inevitably need the object again and spend hours searching for it. This technology could speed up this searching process, a processer able to scan your room in seconds through your phone camera, before alerting you to the location of your missing object. This would remove much wasted time and allow you to return to your hobby sooner. However, this relys on your phone having a camera of a high enough quality to give a high enough resolution image of the smallest objects in the room for your processer to detect. As well as this, there is always the risk of it not seeing the object, causing you to move on from searching this room despite the objects presence there.
